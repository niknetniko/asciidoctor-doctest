== 1.5.2.0 (2015-04-04)

Improvements::
  * Update https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier[htmlbeautifier] to 1.0.0 and remove workaround in `html/html_beautifier` [{commit-uri}/6caafb0[6caafb0]].
  * Extract formatting (serialization) of example’s options into `BaseExamplesSuite#format_options` to be reusable [{commit-uri}/c4d779c[c4d779c]].
  * Implement serialization of examples suite into AsciiDoc [{commit-uri}/900aab8[900aab8]].
  * Replace custom core extensions, ActiveSupport and Colorize with https://github.com/jirutka/corefines[Corefines].

[{commit-uri}/50e05c1[50e05c1], {commit-uri}/2f4a42e[2f4a42e]]

Bug fixes::

== 1.5.1.1 (2014-12-30)

Bug fixes::
  * Avoid setting `backend_name` to an empty string.
    When there’s an empty string and code highlighter is set to Pygments or CodeRay, then Asciidoctor doesn’t highlight listings at all. [{commit-uri}/bf5f077[bf5f077]]
  * Update https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier[htmlbeautifier] to 0.0.11 that doesn’t modify content of `pre` element and adds newlines around block elements. {issue-uri}/3[#3] [{commit-uri}/4aaa137[4aaa137]]


== 1.5.1 (2014-12-29)

Improvements::
  * Rename parameter `renderer_opts` to `converter_opts` and method `render` to `convert` to be consistent with Asciidoctor (old names are aliased for now). {issue-uri}/2[#2] [{commit-uri}/97c06af[97c06af]]
  * Rename `to_s` to `content_pretty` in BaseExample and make alias. [{commit-uri}/3b610e2[3b610e2]]

Bug fixes::
  * Allow to modify default `examples_path` in GeneratorTask (was frozen). [{commit-uri}/7251e6c[7251e6c]]
  * Fix `template_dirs` validation and default `backend_name` in AsciidocRenderer. [{commit-uri}/2a4413d[2a4413d]]
  * Beautify generated HTML examples. [{commit-uri}/e9d42be[e9d42be]]
  * Fix Generator to not lose description of the updated example. [{commit-uri}/0d2f4ee[0d2f4ee]]

Tests::
  * Add end-to-end integration tests using Cucumber.
  * Increase (unit) test coverage from 84.2% to 88.5%.
